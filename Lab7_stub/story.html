    <H1>The time I learned to play guitar and got into a band</H1>

        <p>
            In my first semester of my college I met a friend who played guitar. I was instantly hooked to it and started larning. I borrowed a guitar from a distant relative and I joined a private tuition for learing guitar. I Learned a lot of Indian and western songs.

          Eventually, in my second year, I got into a band. It was my college band. We performed at a lot of college events and competed in a lot of rock competitions. I met a lot of people and made a lot  of memories :D.
